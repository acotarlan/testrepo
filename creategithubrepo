Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

    Go to GitHub.com and log in to your account.

    Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select New repository.

    Fill in the details:

        Repository Name: Name your project.

        Description: Optional but recommended.

        Public/Private: Choose visibility.

        Initialize with a README: Optional.

    Click Create repository.

Step 2: Open Your Xcode Project

    Launch Xcode.

    Open your project (or create a new one).

    Make sure your project folder is properly organized and contains a .gitignore file (more on this later).

Step 3: Initialize Git in Your Project

    Open Terminal.

    Navigate to your Xcode project directory:

cd /path/to/your/project

Initialize a new Git repository:

git init

Add all project files:

git add .

Commit the changes:

    git commit -m "Initial commit"

Step 4: Add Remote Repository

Link your local repository to the GitHub remote repository:

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git

Replace username and repository with your actual GitHub username and repo name.
Step 5: Push the Project to GitHub

Push your initial commit to the GitHub repository:

git push -u origin master

If using the main branch (common with newer repositories), use:

git push -u origin main

Step 6: Configure Your .gitignore File (Important!)

Since Xcode projects generate a lot of unnecessary files, use a .gitignore file to exclude them:

    Create a .gitignore file in your project root:

touch .gitignore

Open it with a text editor:

nano .gitignore

Add the following content:

    # Xcode
    *.xcuserstate
    *.xcworkspace
    *.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace
    *.xcodeproj/xcuserdata
    *.xcodeproj/xcuserdata/*
    *.pbxuser
    *.mode1v3
    *.mode2v3
    build/
    DerivedData/
    *.DS_Store

    Save and exit.

Commit the .gitignore:

git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore"
git push

Step 7: Verify Your Project on GitHub

    Go to your repository URL:

    https://github.com/username/repository

    Check that your files are successfully uploaded.

ðŸ’¡ Alternative: Using Xcodeâ€™s Built-In Git Support

    In Xcode, go to:

Source Control > New Git Repositories

You will see your project being version-controlled.

To push directly from Xcode:

    Go to Source Control > Commit.

    Select changes to commit.

    Click Push to Remote to upload to GitHub.
